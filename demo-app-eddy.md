# Demo Application

To show off Splade's amazing capabilities, we've built a demo application that we actually use in production. The app is called **Eddy Server Management**, and it does exactly what it says on the tin: It provisions and manages servers and allows you to deploy PHP applications with zero downtime. You may find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/protonemedia/eddy-server-management) and the live application on [eddy.management](https://eddy.management).

This page will be updated soon with code examples of how Eddy uses Splade.
